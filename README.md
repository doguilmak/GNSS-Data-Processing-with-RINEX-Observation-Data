
# GNSS Data Processing with RINEX Observation Data

## Project Description

Within this repository, you can find the tasks of **GNSS Data Processing** course given by **Prof. Dr. SÅ‚awomir Cellmer**. Mathematical equations created for the data in the course and their explanations are explained in .pdf files in the ***PDF's*** folder. From there, you can have an idea about the course content and learn how the studies are done step by step. The aim of the course is, useing mathematical formulas and filtering on GNSS data downloaded from [BKG](https://igs.bkg.bund.de/) website. Studies were conducted on **6 different exercises**. The .txt files were given to us by the Professor.
