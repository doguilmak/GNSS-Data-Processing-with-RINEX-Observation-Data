
# GNSS Data Processing with RINEX Observation Data

## Project Description

Within this repository, you can find the tasks of **GNSS Data Processing** course given by **Prof. Dr. SÅ‚awomir Cellmer**. You can find the process and mathematical equations for the data processing with explanations in .pdf files in the ***PDF's*** folder. From there, you can have an idea about the course content and learn how the studies are done step by step. The aim of the course is, using mathematical formulas and filtering GNSS data where we get from [BKG](https://igs.bkg.bund.de/) website. Studies were conducted on **6 different exercises**. The .txt files were given to us by the Professor.
